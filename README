This software is a c++ implementation of the algorithm RoDan proposed by Jia Wang. To compile this project, the Eigen has to be put at the root directory, or you can create a link flag during the compilation. The software has been developed and tested in the following platform: Ubuntu 14.04, clang 3.7. If you are using gcc, just modify the make file.

The input files are:
mygraph.edges
mygraph.nodefeat

In each file, we have rows of data. E.g., in mygraph.edges 1 2 would mean there is an edge from 1 to 2. in mygraph.nodefeat, 1 2 would mean node 1 has attribute 2.

In case that there is some isolated node, whose information is not appearing in the .edge file. One has to list all the nodes by indicating there is a link to the node itself. This is just for the sake of IO. The self referential edges would not be considered in the actual algorithm.

E.g. For the following graph, 1 is only connected to 2. And 3,4 are two isolated graph. Then in the .edge file, one should see
1 2
2 1
3 3
4 4

The same rule applies to .nodefeat file, if some attributes is not used by any node (which is highly impossible)

The outputs are saved by default to the current folder, and further visualization could be realized.
