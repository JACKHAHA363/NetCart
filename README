To compile this project, the Eigen has to be put at the root directory.
The input data format are:
mygraph.edges
mygraph.nodefeat

In each file, we have rows of data. 
E.g., in mygraph.edges 1 2 would mean there is an edge from 1 to 2. in mygraph.nodefeat, 1 2 would mean node 1 has attribute 2.

In case that there is some isolated node, whose information is not appearing in the .edge file. One has to list all the nodes by indicating there is a link to the node itself. 
E.g. For the following graph, 1 is only connected to 2. And 3,4 are two isolated graph. Then in the .edge file, one should see
1 2
2 1
3 3
4 4

The same rule applies to .nodefeat file, if some attributes is not used by any node (which is highly impossible)
